In RenderTwitchVotes_Patches.adjustVoteTextPositions, we could use an implMethod1 and an implMethod2 to get two different implementations depending on callNum. So before we call `m.replace`, we would check if (callNum == 3) then replace it with an impl2 method, otherwise replace it with an impl1 method. The impl2 method then would just render the Twitch vote remaining time. That would mean at game run time, it doesn't have to test for if callNum == 3 on every frame. It will only be at patching time that this occurs.

(A) In RenderTwitchVotes_Patches.adjustVoteTextPositions, for FontHelper.renderFontCentered calls, it might be better to just get the relic positions using relic.currentX and relic.currentY. We already know the relicSlot index so we can just get the correct relic from the bossRelics list and retrieve its position from there. Then remember to subtract 75 from the y position.

For the above two, it might be best to avoid using implMethods entirely and just replace the x and y coordinate using `$4 =` and `$5 =` before calling a `$proceed($$)`. Since we can just get x and y positions from the relics in the relic list fairly simply, it isn't complicated to replace.

Maybe check if !AbstractDungeon.isScreenUp to our CardCrawlGame_render_Patches.renderBossChestTips(). Now sure what it does but it is checked in AbstractRelic.render() before it calls renderBossTip(), so maybe that's important.

AbstractRelic.render() also checks if AbstractDungeon.screen == AbstractDungeon.CurrentScreen.SHOP before it calls renderBossTip(). Not sure why this is the case as boss relics can't be in shops. Is there maybe a custom run modifier that lets you buy boss relics in shops, where this is then needed? But even if they were in a shop it could just render the boss relic tip like any normal relic tooltip, presumably. So need to investigate more why this test is done.

Risk of Relics: Focused Convergence compatibility:

If we do the above change (A), we wouldn't even need to test for whether the player has Focused Convergence in our getAdjustedRelicSlotPosition(), and use the same positioning as the mod. We would just get whatever position the mod has set from the relic itself.
